Boilerplate app to get you up and running with Hapi, HTTP2, Web Socket and React.

Demo can be found [here](https://hapi-boilerplate-docker.herokuapp.com/index)

## Project Overview 🤓

I've written a [blog article](http://hackerlite.xyz/2017/12/13/boilerplate-for-hapi-js-web-socket-http-2-react-and-redux/) detailing the steps I've gone through to create. Also the good 😇, the bad 👿 and the ugly ☠️.

## Get it running locally 🏌️

Assuming you are on Mac OS 🍏 and Node 8.9.3 or higher installed. Not tested on any other OS.

In the terminal run the following: -

* `git clone git@github.com:blairg/hapi-socket-react-boilerplate.git`
* `cd hapi-socket-react-boilerplate`
* Create certificate for HTTPS `npm run createCertificate`. Fill in the questions when asked. Can be fictitious values.
* `npm i`
* `npm run dev`
* In your browser go to `https://localhost:3000/index` (add security exception rule for local cert)
* 👏

### With docker 🐳

Ensure you have created the cert and key as per the previous step.

Assuming you have cloned the repo and installed the packages. Also, that you have Docker and Docker Compose installed too. In the terminal do the following, in the root of the directory you cloned the repo too: -

* Create certificate for HTTPS `npm run createCertificate`. Details are all optional.
* Create an `.env` file, this can be blank as the Dockerfile has default values set.
* `docker-compose up`
* In your browser go to `https://localhost:3000/index` (add security exception rule for local cert)

## Running tests 👩‍🔬👨‍🔬

Following options: -

* To just run the unit tests -> `npm run test`
* To run tests with coverage (Istanbul) -> `npm run test:coverage`. This will output to `coverage` folder. Locate the `index.html` in here and open in your browser.
* To watch tests for changes -> `npm run test:watch`
* In VS Code you have 2 debug options avaiable for tests. `Unit Tests` will execute tests. `Tests with Coverage`, will run tests with coverage.

## Linting 🔍

* In the terminal run ESLint with -> `npm run lint`

## Prettier 🙏

* In the terminal run Prettier with -> `npm run pretty`
