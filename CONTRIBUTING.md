# Rules

If anyone want's to contribute or for me to change/add/remove anything I'll be deligthed.

Try and keep the coverage to 90% (green badge on coveralls). Also, make sure you are using latest versions of modules where possible. Add tests for new features or changes to existing code.

## Update Changelog

Make sure you bump up the package version and add an entry to `CHANGELOG.md`.
